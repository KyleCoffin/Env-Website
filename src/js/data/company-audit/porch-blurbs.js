    'West Seattle': 'Adding a new office in West Seattle (Best Seattle) would save us about 70,000 pounds of CO2 each month.  This mostly comes from a drop in average commute time since all the cool employees live in West Seattle and could walk to work.',
    'Bothell Office': 'Adding a new office in Seattle would cut our emissions in half.  This comes from a huge reduction in commute distance and time.',
    'Carpool Program': 'This assume we get about ~10% of solo drivers to carpool.  The savings come from driving less miles in aggregate.',
    'Moved to Canton': 'Adding a second Canton office would increase our footprint in 2 ways.  First, people would have a slightly longer commute (Atlanta is surprisingly worse than Seattle).  Secondly, utility costs would go up.  Washington gets most of its electricity via hydroelectric vs Georgia which is mostly Coal and Natural Gas.'
